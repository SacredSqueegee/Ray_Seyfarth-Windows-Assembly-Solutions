This repo will contain my solutions to the problems at the end of each chapter in the book "Introduction to 64 Bit Windows Assembly Language Programming" by Ray Seyfarth. As I go through the book I might make my own errata document located in the root directory with errors that I find throughout the text. Already going through the book I've noticed a few typos in charts and in the exercise questions. For the errors in the exercise questions I will include a bug callout card explaining what I believe the error to be and any fixes/assumptions I made to fix the error in order to solve the problem.

If going through the solutions in this repo with your own studies, I would recommend cloning this repo and opening the root folder as an obsidian vault. Although you could view the markdown files and code in the GitHub browser, obsidian offers some nicer formatting. Specifically, these files utilize the callout formatting to offer a "spoiler" warning before showing you the answer.
